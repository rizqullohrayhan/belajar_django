## Getting Started

To run this project you will need to set your environment variables.

1. Copy all of the variables inside `djcrm/.template.env` and assign your own values to them
2. Run 
`export READ_DOT_ENV_FILE=True` or 
`set READ_DOT_ENV_FILE=True` or
`$env:READ_DOT_ENV_FILE="True"`
inside your terminal so that your environment variables file will be read.
